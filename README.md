# Survey Data Analysis


## Introduction

The Survey Data analysis app in brief gets the survey data from a google sheet using an API, then based off the option a user selects calculates the data. The app calculates data for average age, percentage of males, percentage of females and average salary. The app also will allow the user to input survey data manually if more survey data needs to be added. This data calculation allows insight into the survey results and will help the user understand the statistics.

Opportunities where listed out to decided what features to build

| Opportunity                          | Importance | Viability/Feasability |
| ------------------------------------ | ---------- | --------------------- | 
| Options List                         | 5          | 5                     | 
| Add data to survey                   | 2          | 2                     |
| Most popular Industry                | 2          | 1                     |
| Average Salary                       | 3          | 3                     |

With this table done it was decided that the features to include would be
* Options List
* Average age
* Percentage of Males
* Percentage of Females
* Average Salary

The order you see is the order of precedence, the other features can be considered for later implementation. Work then began on user stories and flow charts.

User stories consisted of me placing myself in the shoes of a user who wanted to get some insight into statistical data of a survey.
* User
    * As a user, I want to be able to choose between options for data to be displayed to me.
    * As a user, I want to be able to know the average age of all entries.
    * As a user, I want to be able to know the percentages of Males and Females in the survey.
    * As a user, I want to be able to know what the average salary of the entries is.

Flow charts where drawn up to aid with decision of how the app would function
