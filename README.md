### Survey Data Analysis


## Introduction

The Survey Data analysis app in brief gets the survey data from a google sheet using an API, then based off the option a user selects calculates the data. The app calculates data for average age, percentage of males, percentage of females and average salary. The app also will allow the user to input survey data manually if more survey data needs to be added. This data calculation allows insight into the survey results and will help the user understand the statistics.
